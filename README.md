## Overview
### Description
[Description of your app]
	An application for people who want one-on-one file transfer. It is a simple application to use and save for users to transfer the file.
### App Evaluation
[Evaluation of your app across the following attributes]
- **Category:**
	Utility Mobile Application
- **Mobile:**
	Confidential and Convenient 
- **Story:**
The value of the app is very clear to the audience because of how simple and secure the app is. My friends and audience will respond very well to the idea because all of them send files to each other and having an easy, reliable, and secure app like ours to do so is very important to people.
Users open the app and login in. Then, they add the username of the receiver,add PIN and select the File. They will get the security code after sending it.  Receiver should get PIN and code from other social media, then enter these to receive the file. Both Sender and receiver could view the file history.
- **Market:**
This app is good for the user who looks for an application that could safely send a file to someone else such as Companies and professionals. Yes, the app does provide huge value to a group of niche people (companies).
- **Habit:**
The users will keep using it when they want to send or receive a file on Android (which can be very frequently). The users of our app consume the app when they receive files from other people and create when they send files to other people.
- **Scope:**

Our app has well defined scopes and will be technically challenging but feasible to accomplish by the end of the program. The stripped down version of the app will be interesting to build as well because it will still contain advanced security checks to make sure people do not send files to the wrong person.
